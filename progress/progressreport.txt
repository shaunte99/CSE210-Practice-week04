Looking back at the two assignments, I'm feeling proud of what I've managed to get done, 
but also really aware of how much I struggled with certain parts. 
These tasks pushed me to think differently, and while it was tough, 
I’m happy with how much I learned.

The abstraction assignment was especially tricky for me. 
I had a hard time wrapping my head around how to break things down 
into smaller chunks and group them into classes. I knew the theory behind it, 
but actually applying it to write code wasn’t easy. 
I had to try a few different approaches, and sometimes 
it felt like I wasn’t making progress. But eventually, 
I figured it out and got a program running that showed I understood the basic concepts 
of abstraction.

The encapsulation task also gave me a lot of headaches. 
There was a lot to remember with private variables, getters, setters, 
and how to keep everything in its right place. 
I could see the importance of keeping data safe, 
but getting the syntax and structure right felt like a challenge. 
It was hard to visualize how the different parts of the program were connected, 
but I pushed through and eventually got it working.

A big part of why I was able to finish both assignments was the help I got from ChatGPT. 
I could pinpoint mistakes faster, and 
getting feedback on how to improve made the debugging process a lot smoother. 
It saved me so much time and helped me see where I was going wrong. 
Even though I still feel a bit shaky on some parts especially the deeper details of 
encapsulation and how classes interact—I feel like I’ve made good progress.

Honestly, I wish I had more time to really dive into the concepts and make sure 
I understood everything at a deeper level. But with the time I had, 
I’m happy with the results. I’ve definitely grown as a programmer, 
but I can see that there’s still a lot I need to work on.

Looking ahead, I’m excited to keep improving. 
I know there are going to be more tough moments, 
but I’m motivated to keep going. These assignments taught me a lot about problem-solving 
and how to work with classes, and I'm eager to see where it takes me next. 
Even though it wasn’t easy, I'm grateful for the progress I’ve made and how much 
I’ve learned.
